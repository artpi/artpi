As my day job, I help build online businesses at Tumblr & WordPress.com. I created this site to explore how global consciousness reshapes society, economy, labor, and art. I focus on:

- Helping to create a healthy economy in the magical land of the Internet,
- Channeling the power of technology, capitalism and human creativity towards sustainable stewardship for our planet and other species,
- Making Remote Work work, so you get to find a fulfilling vocation regardless of where youâ€™re born.
